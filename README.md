# Strategic Decision Analytics

This book is a course in probabilistic decision analytics with a focus on strategic decisions. By a strategic decision we mean the following:

- A decision which substantionally affects the achievement of the vision, mission, and purpose of the organization. Such a decision would often be deferred to the Board of Directors or Trustees of the organization with regard for the delegation of authority from the Board to Management.

- A materially substantive decision such as the acquisition of a competitor in a new market, representing a 20\% change in potential revenues, numerous legal, tax, environmental, political, and even cultural changes in the organization.

- A decision for which there is anticipated a strong and persistent reaction, possibly retaliatory, possible and new entrant or even an exit by a competitor, including the competitor's supply chain.

- A decision, whose prosecution requires a major restructuring of the organization, including culture, commitments, resourcing, legal and compliance requirements, hierarchies, networks, and markets.

A decision is a compound of the organizational, and individuals within an organization, experiance, understanding, judgments, in a word knowledge, coupled with action, namely the decision.
