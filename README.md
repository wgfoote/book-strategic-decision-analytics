# Strategic Decision Analytics

So we completed extensive data analysis on every conceivable scenario we could imagine. We have inferences prioritized, socialized among various stakeholders, revised views and options. The explanations, plausibilities are at the least consistent with the qualitative and quantitative data we had available. We even made plans and resourced a team to revise our expectations as new data arrives. We know that the job is barely half done! Now what do we do? Do we simply extend whatever models we built, more data, more variables, more structure? Do we tweak with how we manage unobserved anything like missing observations and missing variables?

Yes, of course! Some of this is hardly a tweak. We cannot avoid any further how the learnings, the inferences, can be incorporated explicitly in our strategic decisions. We pose a table-top exercise to help us understand the components of such an undertaking. We do know, in our probabilistic hearts, that we should use posterior predictive probability intervals throughout our understanding of the impact on the outcomes of decisions. We already know how to build our current beliefs into prior predictive probabilities, at least we think we do. In going forward we also know that our preferences are given by the model as much as they are built into our models.

## Strategic decisions

This book is a course in probabilistic decision analytics with a focus on strategic decisions. By a strategic decision we mean the following:

- A decision which substantionally affects the achievement of the vision, mission, and purpose of the organization. Such a decision would often be deferred to the Board of Directors or Trustees of the organization with regard for the delegation of authority from the Board to Management.

- A materially substantive decision such as the acquisition of a competitor in a new market, representing a 20\% change in potential revenues, numerous legal, tax, environmental, political, and even cultural changes in the organization.

- A decision for which there is anticipated a strong and persistent reaction, possibly retaliatory, possible and new entrant or even an exit by a competitor, including the competitor's supply chain.

- A decision, whose prosecution requires a major restructuring of the organization, including culture, commitments, resourcing, legal and compliance requirements, hierarchies, networks, and markets.

A decision is a compound of the organizational, and individuals within an organization, experiance, understanding, judgments, in a word knowledge, coupled with action, namely the decision.
