abstract = {In recent work, Signorino (American Political Science Review 93:279-297, 1999; International Interactions 28:93-115, 2002) has sought to test statistical models derived from extensive-form games in the context of international relations research focusing on conflict and interstate bargaining. When two or more actors interact with one another under conditions of uncertainty, Signorino demonstrates that it is necessary to incorporate such strategic interaction into the underlying model to avoid potential threats to statistical inference. Outside the realm of international relations research, however, there have been limited applications of Signorino's strategic probit model in understanding strategic interaction. In this article, I present an empirical comparison of probit and strategic probit models in the context of candidate competition in House elections during the 1990s. I show that incumbent spending deters challenger entry and factors such as minority party affiliation and redistricting significantly affect incumbent career decisions, findings that run counter to those reported in the nonstrategic model. Overall, the results illustrate that failing to account for strategic interaction can lead to biased and inaccurate estimates related to challenger and incumbent entry decisions.},

As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently over-looked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors' own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

Typical applications of logit and probit to theories of international conflict generally do not capture the structure of the strategic interdependence implied by those theories. I demonstrate how to derive statistical discrete choice models of international conflict that directly incorporate the theorized strategic interaction. I show this for a simple crisis interaction model and then use Monte Carlo analysis to show that logit provides estimates with incorrect substantive interpretations as well as fitted values that can be far from the true values. Finally, I reanalyze a well-known game-theoretic model of war, Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's (1992) international interaction game. My results indicate that there is at best modest empirical support for their model.},

abstract = {Common regression models are often structurally inconsistent with strategic interaction. We demonstrate that this "strategic misspecification" is really an issue of structural (or functional form) misspecification. The misspecification can be equivalently written as a form of omitted variable bias, where the omitted variables are nonlinear terms arising from the players' expected utility calculations and often from data aggregation. We characterize the extent of the specification error in terms of model parameters and the data and show that typical regressions models can at times give exactly the opposite inferences versus the true strategic data-generating process. Researchers are recommended to pay closer attention to their theoretical models, the implications of those models concerning their statistical models, and vice versa.},

Using the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion to measure the closeness of a model to the truth, we propose simple likelihood-ratio based statistics for testing the null hypothesis that the competing models are equally close to the true data generating process against the alternative hypothesis that one model is closer. The tests are directional and are derived successively for the cases where the competing models are non-nested, overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified. As a prerequisite, we fully characterize the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditions. We show that it is a weighted sum of chi-square distribution or a normal distribution depending on whether the distributions in the competing models closest to the truth are observationally identical. We also propose a test of this latter condition.},

abstract = {A wide variety of tools are available, both parametric and nonparametric, for analyzing spatial data. However, it is not always clear how to translate statistical inferences into decision recommendations. This article explores the possibilities of estimating the effects of decision options using very direct manipulation of data, bypassing formal statistical analysis. We illustrate with the application that motivated this research, a study of arsenic in drinking water in nearly 5,000 wells in a small area in rural Bangladesh. We estimate the potential benefits of two possible remedial actions: (1) recommendations that people switch to nearby wells with lower arsenic levels; and (2) drilling new community wells. We use simple nonparametric clustering methods and estimate uncertainties using cross-validation.},

abstract = {This paper examines the economic justification for the use of differential tariffs to control for positive and negative externalities embodied in traded products. In particular, economic efficiency requires that taxes and subsidies should be applied to internalize external costs or benefits. It is argued that products such as timber, minerals, and agricultural products that produce large negative environmental externalities should be differentially tariffed to either provide an incentive to cease destructive practices, or provide funding for amelioration. Examples from the mining and agricultural sectors are used to demonstrate the magnitude of tariffs required to offset the estimated environmental damage. Products with embedded cultural content are used as examples of exports that may possess positive externalities, and should be subject to a subsidy.}

And if one thinks over that proposition it becomes more and more evident that life can never really be understood in time simply because at no particular moment can I find the necessary resting-place from which to understand it—backwards.

title = "A tutorial on testing hypotheses using the Bayes factor",
abstract = "Learning about hypothesis evaluation using the Bayes factor could enhance psychological research. In contrast to null-hypothesis significance testing it renders the evidence in favor of each of the hypotheses under consideration (it can be used to quantify support for the null-hypothesis) instead of a dichotomous reject/do-not-reject decision; it can straightforwardly be used for the evaluation of multiple hypotheses without having to bother about the proper manner to account for multiple testing; and it allows continuous reevaluation of hypotheses after additional data have been collected (Bayesian updating). This tutorial addresses researchers considering to evaluate their hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used. It will be elaborated in a completely nontechnical manner: what the Bayes factor is, how it can be obtained, how Bayes factors should be interpreted, and what can be done with Bayes factors. After reading this tutorial and executing the associated code, researchers will be able to use their own data for the evaluation of hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor, not only in the context of ANOVA models, but also in the context of other statistical models.",

abstract = {This paper presents an operational metric for univariate unimodal probability distributions with finite first moments in [0,1], where 0 is maximally thin-tailed (Gaussian) and 1 is maximally fat-tailed. It is based on the question, “how much data does one need to make meaningful statements about a given dataset?” Applications: Among others, it •helps to determine the sample size n needed for statistical significance outside the Gaussian distribution,•helps to measure the speed of convergence to the Gaussian (or stable basin),•allows practical comparisons across classes of fat-tailed distributions,•allows the number of securities needed in portfolio construction to achieve a certain level of risk-reduction from diversification to be assessed,•helps in assessing risks under various settings, and•helps to explain some inconsistent attributes of the lognormal, depending on the parametrization of its variance. The literature in regard to asymptotic behavior is rich, but there is a large void regarding finite values of n, which are those that are needed for operational purposes. Background: Conventional measures of fat-tailedness, namely (1) the tail index for the power law class, and (2) the kurtosis for finite moment distributions, fail to apply to some distributions, and do not allow comparisons across classes and parametrization; that is, between power laws outside the Levy-stable basin, or power laws and distributions in other classes, or power laws for different numbers of summands. How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t distributed random variables with three degrees of freedom to one in a Levy-stable or a Lognormal class? How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t with three degrees of freedom to a single Student t with two degrees of freedom? We propose an operational and heuristic metric that allows us to compare n-summed independent variables under all distributions with finite first moments. The method is based on the rate of convergence of the law of large numbers for finite sums, specifically n-summands. We get either explicit expressions or simulation results and bounds for the lognormal, exponential, Pareto, and Student t distributions in their various calibrations, in addition to the general Pearson classes.}

Its versatility as a tool for informing on numerous issues of interest to those involved in futures studies is self-evident yet under-appreciated, not as a predicting device but as a framing one, much as with how catalysts work in chemistry. This piece first briefly describes the basics of the dialectical process and its application as an outcome framing method. Its connections with other forecasting methods especially with emerging issues analysis is discussed. The properties of dialectical processes are dynamic and do not necessarily conform to human-scale either temporally or spatially. Dialectical process related to social change and worldview are not subordinate to cyclic time except when artificially imposed as with political elections. The dialectical process being consistent with quantum mechanics especially as applied to technological impacts and legal enactment process will be discussed. In the latter instance, the dark matter and dark energy conundrum bear the hallmarks of a dialectical process thus far leading to an indeterminable resolution. While several examples of persistent issue contradictions to which dialectical analysis can be usefully applied are available, American health care policy is highlighted here. }

  abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.  The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.  Features   Integrates working code into the main text   Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples   Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code   Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections   Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs   Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub},

    abstract = "{This paper constructs a theoretical model to investigate the relationship between the two major forms of terrorism and foreign direct investment (FDI). We analyze with various estimators how these relationships are affected by foreign aid flows by focusing on 78 developing countries for 1984-2008. Both types of terrorism are found to depress FDI. Aggregate aid mitigates the negative consequences of domestic and transnational terrorism, but this aid appears more robust in ameliorating the adverse effect of domestic terrorism. However, when aid is subdivided, bilateral aid is effective in reducing the adverse effects of transnational terrorism on FDI, whereas multilateral aid is effective in curbing the adverse effects of domestic terrorism on FDI. For transnational terrorism, there is evidence in the literature that donor countries earmark some bilateral aid to counterterrorism. Aid ability to curb the risk to FDI from terrorism is important because FDI is an important engine of development.}",

It begins by introducing essential concepts including domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism, defensive actions, proactive countermeasures, and guerrilla warfare. Three terrorist event databases, used by seven of the articles, are briefly introduced. These data sets are then used to display some stylized facts about domestic and transnational terrorism during the past four decades. Next, some essential strategic distinctions are drawn between defensive and proactive measures in the case of transnational terrorism when multiple countries are confronted by a common terrorist group. These strategic concerns vanish for domestic terrorism as a central government is able to internalize potential externalities. Finally, the key findings of the articles in the special issue are highlighted in two tables.}",

 abstract = {This paper introduces a new solution method based on Goal Programming for Multiple Objective Decision Making (MODM) problems. The method, called Interactive Sequential Goal Programming (ISGP), combines and extends the attractive features of both Goal Programming and interactive solution approaches for MODM problems. ISGP is applicable to both linear and non-linear problems. It uses existing single objective optimization techniques and, hence, available computer codes utilizing these techniques can be adapted for use in ISGP. The non-dominance of the "best-compromise" solution is assured. The information required from the decision maker in each iteration is simple. The proposed method is illustrated by solving a nutrition problem.},

It is shown how to take advantage of the form of the limited memory approximation to implement the algorithm efficiently. The results of numerical tests on a set of large problems are reported. }
